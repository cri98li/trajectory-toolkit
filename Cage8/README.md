# CageX: CAnonical Geospatial features

In this repository we want to collect and implement methods to extract 
from a set of raw GPS coordinates features that enrich the dataset, 
but which, simultaneously also allow dimensionality reduction.

## Features:

- Speed: AVG, STD, MIN, MAX
- Acceleration: AVG, STD, MIN, MAX
- Turning Angle: AVG, STD, MIN, MAX
- Traveled Distance: SUM
- Stop Rate
